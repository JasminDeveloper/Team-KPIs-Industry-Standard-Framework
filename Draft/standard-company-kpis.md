# Standard Company KPIs for Technology Teams

This document outlines the recommended KPIs that standard companies should adopt across their technology departments. These KPIs are designed to provide a balanced view of team performance while focusing on the most impactful metrics for business success.

## Universal KPIs for All Technology Teams

These core KPIs should be implemented across all technology departments regardless of their specific focus:

| Lead Time for Changes | <2 days | Indicates workflow efficiency |
| Change Failure Rate | <15% | Measures quality of deployments |
| Mean Time to Recovery | <1 hour | Shows resilience to failures |
| Sprint Velocity | Stable trend | Helps predict delivery timelines |
| Cycle Time | 1-3 days for small tasks | Identifies workflow bottlenecks |
| Commitment Reliability | 85-95% | Improves planning accuracy |

### 2. Code Quality

| Test Coverage | >80% | Reduces bugs and regressions |
| Linting Compliance | 0 errors | Maintains consistent code style |
| Code Complexity | <15 cyclomatic complexity | Improves maintainability |
| Code Duplication | <5% | Reduces maintenance burden |
| Documentation Coverage | >80% | Facilitates knowledge sharing |
| Technical Debt Ratio | 10-20% sprint capacity | Prevents accumulation of problems |

### 3. Performance & Reliability

### 4. Security & Compliance

| KPI | Target | Why It Matters |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| Dependency Vulnerabilities | 0 critical/high | Prevents security breaches |
| Security Scan Coverage | 100% | Identifies vulnerabilities early |
| Compliance Adherence | 100% | Meets regulatory requirements |
| Security Bug Resolution | <24 hours | Reduces exposure time |
| Authentication Success Rate | >99.9% | Ensures system security |
| Data Encryption Coverage | 100% | Protects sensitive information |
| Security Training Completion | 100% of team | Builds security awareness |

### 5. Team Health & Growth

| KPI | Target | Why It Matters |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| Knowledge Sharing | >1 session per sprint | Reduces single points of failure |
| Onboarding Time | <2 weeks to first PR | Accelerates team growth |
| Team Satisfaction | >4/5 | Improves retention and productivity |
| Cross-training Coverage | >2 people per component | Reduces bus factor |
| Learning Time Allocation | >10% of work time | Encourages skill development |
| Innovation Time | >10% of sprint | Fosters creative solutions |
| Certification/Training Completion | 2+ per year per person | Ensures team stays current |

## Implementation Strategy

For companies implementing these KPIs, we recommend the following approach:

1. **Start Small** - Begin with 3-5 key metrics from each category
2. **Automate Measurement** - Invest in tools that collect metrics automatically
3. **Visualize Data** - Create dashboards that show trends over time
4. **Regular Reviews** - Schedule weekly/monthly reviews of KPIs
5. **Continuous Refinement** - Adjust targets based on team feedback and business needs
6. **Focus on Trends** - Look for improvement over time rather than absolute numbers
7. **Balance Metrics** - Ensure teams aren't optimizing for one metric at the expense of others

## Best Practices for KPI Implementation

1. **Align with Business Goals** - Connect technical KPIs to business outcomes
2. **Avoid Micromanagement** - Use KPIs for team improvement, not individual evaluation
3. **Celebrate Improvements** - Recognize progress and positive trends
4. **Contextualize Data** - Consider external factors that may affect metrics
5. **Involve Teams** - Get buy-in from teams on which metrics matter most
6. **Review Periodically** - Assess whether KPIs still measure what matters
7. **Transparent Reporting** - Share KPI data openly with the team

## Department-Specific Focus Areas

While the universal KPIs apply to all teams, each department should emphasize specific metrics based on their domain:

### HTML & CSS Teams
- Accessibility compliance
- Visual consistency
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance optimization

### Laravel Teams
- Database query optimization
- API response times
- Framework best practices
- Server resource utilization

### Node.js Teams
- Event loop performance
- Asynchronous processing efficiency
- Memory management
- Scalability metrics

### React Teams
- Component reusability
- Bundle size optimization
- Render performance
- State management efficiency

## Conclusion

Implementing these standard KPIs across technology departments provides a balanced view of team performance while focusing on metrics that drive business success. Remember that KPIs should be used as tools for improvement, not punishment, and should evolve as your organization grows and matures.
