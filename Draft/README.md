# 📊 Engineering KPI Framework

This document defines the **standard Key Performance Indicator (KPI) structure** followed across all engineering teams and technologies in this repository.

It ensures:
- Consistent quality
- Predictable delivery
- High reliability
- Strong security
- Measurable business impact
- Continuous improvement

This framework acts as the **base template** for all technology-specific KPI documents.

---

## 📂 Applies To

This structure is mandatory for all stacks:

- [React KPIs](React/react-kpis.md)
- [HTML & CSS KPIs](HTML%20&%20CSS/html-css-kpis.md)
- [Laravel KPIs](Laravel/laravel-kpis.md)
- [Node.js KPIs](nodeJs/nodejs-kpis.md)
- Any future technologies

Each technology folder should extend this document with stack-specific KPIs.
